Keeping track of what I've drawn from the "Zombies Run" story, mainly [codex](https://zrx.app/codex)/supply items: 

- [x] Zombie
	Just a run-of-the-mill long dead walker you wouldn't want to be locked in with. 
	![](zombie_scaled_16x_pngcrushed.png))
	
- [ ]  9mm Ammo

	A box of ammunition for a 9mm pistol. It’s about two-thirds full. These bullets will save lives.
	    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/27f2cd88f6f52787ddd1cb1d6c8e0381e82eb5be-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Antibiotics

	A packet of generic antibiotics. There are still enough left for a decent course of treatment. These things are gold-dust nowadays.

	![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/dcd3b31358011af3792e2daee28fd4fcecef27d6-h_150_2x.png)
    
- [ ]  Anti-depressants

	Surprisingly, the apocalypse hasn’t *improved* anyone’s mental health. While these won’t work for everyone, for some they could mean the difference between life and death.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/61ba1021f39cd4bde25eba6302d69192caacf08a-h_150_2x.png)

- [x]  Axe

	To call this a sharp bit of metal attached to a stick is to insult the brutal efficiency of the mighty axe. Unfortunately, that’s basically what it is. But awesome.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a96e760770268f5da62f894c07d72ab3bcb3f830-h_150_2x.png)
    ![](axe.png)

- [ ]  Bandages

	Absorbent, sterile, pliant. These fabric strips will help keep any wound clean and dry.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/0928a034466ba8643f956ad0ca2e3d461ad0663e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Baton

	Not for twirling or marching, some might say this baton was once an instrument of police brutality. Now it’s an instrument of Runner brutality. Those zombies won’t know what hit them.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/7d3ace141d1779e2fcb3c2ff0ba797c62c50a318-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Batteries

	Batteries are now one of the few sources of power. Unfortunately, there are only three left in this pack. Still, it’s a valuable find.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/92ff3d01ceb5fba072ecbcfd6638d769fec4ba58-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Beach ball

	The nearest beach is a long run away, but don’t let that put you off. Maybe if some of the armoury sandbags accidentally split open, pouring onto the Abel courtyard, the Township could enjoy its first game of volleyball.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/8830f23cb4108f3b9c4123262126221afec7c956-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Baseball Bat

	A solid, dependable weapon. Try to resist yelling “home run” every time you take a head off with it, though.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/6766df5296f250d15a171fb4bee0382b59966640-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Bedroll

	It’s no sleeping bag, but in a pinch a bedroll adds that extra level of comfort when sleeping on the cold hard ground. Or the cold wet ground. Or any ground, really.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/37155e0abf606f7d60a5da8983a70902f2414c47-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Board game

	One of the playing pieces is missing and some of the cards are crumpled, but this board game is definitely still playable. Ah, but the instructions are missing. Never mind, Sam and Doc Myers will figure it out. Or invent new rules. Can’t wait for another round of Demons and Darkness of Catan to Ride!

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/d6ad67a5806a04c3c38bb127a717e5bfd22f3a67-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Book

	In terms of post-apocalypse entertainment, a book is often the best you can get. This should be popular back at Abel.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/54066bddc23644409ba6004e3cd5593734a2ba27-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Boots

	A sturdy pair of thick-heeled, waterproof walking boots. Accidentally step on a crawler in these and there won’t be much left of them to scrape off.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/993b160aa292bfc1601601ced6177599ba1ecef3-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Box of Lightbulbs

	Before the outbreak, no-one gave lightbulbs a second thought. Now, they’re valuable treasure. Fragile, poorly-boxed treasure.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/85e74bf4d8b5a1bee8479776a9b95a31e995a536-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Bottled Water

	A plastic bottle containing water. The seal is unbroken - it should still be good. The label’s come off, though. Why do these things have expiry dates on them?

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/805fe4b60690318c09f7628349aeee947e34c3af-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Playing cards

	Unbelievable. A full set of playing cards. Runner 8 always said she fancied putting a poker night together. No poker chips, so you’ll have to play on a bartering system. Luckily Rajit is terrible at all games, so you could be having hot showers every day, if you, ahem, play your cards right.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/1a6e8656f98727f9c5e29c169e8761b4ddca6b9e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Car Battery

	This’ll be difficult to charge, but being able to store large amounts of power is vitally important. A good find.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/5b3c54c72c86f3f787bbe1f826b7da2219a6b5a8-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Cooking knife

	This knife would be perfect for dicing vegetables in the Abel kitchen - but it might be worth etching “Food only” into the handle, so it that it doesn’t find its way into a zombie’s skull one day.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/abba29ed60c3a362082976a9eaecb46e9cf30624-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Cooking oil

	As rare as cooked breakfasts are, without this they’d never happen at all. You didn’t happen to find any bacon with it, did you? Oh well. Maybe next time.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a421b17c68992e91e338c0fed15fc80c855e8373-h_150_2x.png)

- [x]  Candles

	These will come in handy the next time the Abel generators go down overnight. A perfect opportunity to stay up and tell each other scary stories. Just make sure someone’s looking after Sam this time, so that there aren’t any more accidents...

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/67a2c828a957f2ca85ce0ad195f4d9015bd61da7-h_150_2x.png)
	![](candles.png)
	
- [ ]  Overcoat

	It’s waterproof, warm, and not too badly bloodstained. It’s perfect.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/f66b5c065059e5df4f7336c9d36b2f265dc40f27-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Cricket bat

	Sure, it’s not WG, but it’ll still remove zombie heads from zombie shoulders quicker than you can yell “out!”.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/be79c56a2d0e01cf02723d50255b70320062de34-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Crossbow

	Where on earth did you find this? Does it still work? As far as weapons go, crossbows are quiet, accurate and powerful. Perfect for picking off unsuspecting zoms from a distance.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/5f4ba0f2bb5525576842903d0836761fd2b3a1f1-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Crutches

	They’re basically sticks with handles. But don’t say that to anyone who’s lost the use of a leg. This pair seem to be in pretty good repair.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/cd04775da6f9fceefdc76ee0169934070e7e433f-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Cutlery

	It’s not that anyone minds if people eat with their fingers, but surely the quicker we re-establish basic social etiquette and hygiene, the better.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/7095a506999b2cbb274e074f78005d3e549340e6-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Disposable camera

	Largely useless, since even if there was a dark room nearby, no-one in Abel knows how to develop photos. A lost art even before the world went to hell. Still, it makes that really satisfying clicking noise that only analogue cameras can. Not to mention the kraaaak, kraaaak of the winding mechanism. Ah, simpler times...

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/2c0cd86998444f1c1f60f4a3f133ba9698010eb5-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Dentistry equipment

	This is vital stuff. Some people might object to an anaesthetic-free tooth extraction, but it’s better than toothache. Or at least that’s what Dr Myers keeps saying.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/ef996abb9b5a842127e91b6ee65a55b0d20fe8be-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Deodorant

	Thanks to you, Abel will soon be smelling like a high school disco, but surely that’s better than the alternative?

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/db5711acc98560098a68a2c89a6bde5dc148f7be-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Dress

	It’s warm and comfortable, that’s the main thing. And the pattern conceals the bloodstain brilliantly.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/676a4d08031dfe4f199c5643887e5754824b7610-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  DVD

	Please don’t let it be another copy of Twilight: New Moon... Please don’t let it be another copy of Twilight: New Moon…

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/85f46b5acc60b828ce38ca8377c9a5a222bd6b2b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  First Aid Kit

	A small case full of useful medical supplies: bandages, antiseptic, even some medicine. It’s pretty battered, but most of the stuff inside is intact.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/df13e5c9dffa3138c1e422f591332c671f1e282b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Football

	Abel is home to some pretty avid football fans, so they’ll be very happy to see this. Real football, that is. Where the ball actually comes in contact with a foot more often than not.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b897803f28846a34036c725ac4e40aa4a87f4278-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Fuel Can

	An emergency fuel canister. It’s made from dark green plastic, and is in surprisingly good shape. It’s still mostly full. This is a valuable find.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/95fa36cabf6c9dafac9c2a3c63526efaddbd2214-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Firewood

	It used to be a Louis XIV chair, but the owner isn’t going to complain if you take an axe to it. In fact, by the sound of that cough, you may need to take an axe to the owner.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/6e98f79c1066f126f2b0dbc1c0c81dad0f0a5db9-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Firestarters

	Ironically named, really. Since they’re best used when thrown onto an already started fire. “Fire continuers”, perhaps? Whatever you call them, there are plenty of people around Abel who would be glad to receive a few more of these.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/597d9a0ff18e8e2d8dc988728370eca5ba287798-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Garden tools

	Jack and Eugene will be happy to see these. They have their own little vegetable plot where they’re growing some “hipster veg” seeds they found on their way into Abel. Purple carrots and white tomatoes? Whatever next.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/607045bf6ab105a5ae7e9547543229bc0dcaf288-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Glasses

	One of the lenses is missing, but that’s okay because the other one is a ludicrously strong prescription. Whoever used to own these, chances are they won’t have survived long without them...

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/0e7a8cb5365bd7486f1c3c720da3951a3e403178-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Hairbrush

	The more of these you can find, the less likely it is that there will be a repeat of the Great Summer Nits Outbreak. At least they’re easier to kill than zombies.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/1b162ef7d35fae0ec835dcf587b3e10fd45fc38d-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Hearing Aid

	Greg’s going to be delighted. These things are like gold dust, and sharing his with Jessica and Mrs Tembe has been no fun at all.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/f4e0abc2d5015f1668e2394914b1cca3788f9167-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Horse shoe

	Allegedly, these bring the bearer good luck. Hopefully a bit more luck than the poor horse who lost it in the first place.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/fbc0a98faa059aecc4d18005565226239f902a6b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Insulin

	A small glass vial containing insulin. Someone will be very glad to receive this.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a676a7e4c45e39c1f0dc1576a6a0a4ef76757e6b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Laptop

	Before the outbreak, this thing was the top of the line. Now it’s a dead battery attached to a smorgasboard of spare parts.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/15272a28131c829783fff083a0787b745e84aa22-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Lock pick

	By now, a lot of the towns near Abel have already been looted clean. These lockpicks mean you can get to the valuable stuff that’s hidden away. Such as… ugh, more money? Great.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/55306a5bfcbb9e08b124adfce0fc7bef21dacd6e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Makeup

	It’s when things are at their worst that it’s good to look your best. And Sam will be thrilled you’ve found this – he’s been dying to organise a Rocky Horror night.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/d5070456e8c097b7fe3967b56db6c4b53ddd819e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Money

	See a penny, pick it up, and all that day you’ll have… well, a penny. Not much use now, though.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/3f7368129ed06e722bc9608f089c23ed94148d40-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Mobile Phone

	A broken mobile. Someone must have dropped it while trying to escape. It won’t work, but the parts might be useful.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/258e164be4fef94f73c9467734f087ffe6e1139a-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Matches

	Each match is a wee beacon of hope, symbolising light and life and impending baked beans.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/f2f60b0489dd2ce45602c2de3565e7a5daa1b91b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Air Recycling Filter

	Spare filter module for a Pandora Haze industrial air recycler. Assuming the Venus One colony’s air recyclers are working, this module will help you maintain them.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/608bf39fdfc4059c1b09de9993e79c2653c2fd9c-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Antique Paper Book

	Paperback books are still produced late into the 21st century, as a luxury item. Captain Myers is an avid collector, and the Venus One colony boasts a small paper library. This find will boost crew morale.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/bdd77276e523832977246bff6609a4f8ee6c53b5-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Apodesmos

	A woolen garment of Minoan derivation, wrapped at the front, pinned at the back. Provides support to female Olympians.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/735fa53fbe8f9cc54e5d6e962654e25806d46499-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Air Mask

	Filters the most harmful particles from the atmosphere. Wirelessly linked to health monitors.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b30b6ad38793c9e0114c80b4a3ecbf7cc2a8d74e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Amelia Spens Wanted Beacon

	Once the feared CEO of Pandora Haze, Amelia Spens and her clones have been on the run since a dramatic falling out with her board. These beacons offer a hefty reward for information leading to her capture.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/46cba6854fb373caed0220dad61b30f583271528-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Intelligent Blanket

	This lightweight blanket uses thermal coils to heat and cool itself to the user’s specifications. Beyond that, it’s just a blanket, but at least it’ll give you something soft to sleep on.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/cbd13f9e14678ae97e1510d39641534b0c84c690-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Bonbons

	A small box of delightful chocolate confections, each containing the most wondrous fillings. If you aren't careful, the box will be entirely empty before long...

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/dbc8372f328bd4199af59e15416ac79e0332ac15-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Brooch

	A battered oval brooch made of bronze. It has faded filigree and a strange design, with a running person escaping outstretched hands.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/3f483ed9f05db229e5a0234c1142b6d4128c923a-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Broken Arrow

	This arrow has seen better days, but you might still be able to salvage the head.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/2c7dc466e1272d6237aff123ccc323004114f2dc-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Bottle of Gin

	Mother's Ruin. Depending on the source, could be a delicious apertif, or could be nearly pure alcohol.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b3e3a807b1cf6f4a24d9b9b93372e666c98c1e36-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Boot Polish

	Handy for when you need to make a good impression – or hide you tracks...

- [ ]  PR-50 Bullets

	Box of ammunition for a Pandora Haze PR-50 sidearm. This light pistol cannot penetrate the thick hull of a spacecraft, but it'll still do serious damage to equipment and personnel. For emergency use only.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/33e2668bd50ee7364b56d3f6499a8c9eaa3afe75-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Chain Shirt

	A touch heavy and the quilted inner fabric is starting to fray, but you'll be glad these interlocking metal rings are between you and the pointy end of a foe's weapon.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/ccc209da4c3834b72735cf7edba31ef0448cb339-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Copper Coins

	The most common type of currency. A few of these will let you buy a room for the night or purchase a decent meal in the nearest inn.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/8ea1daa2f8fa16c21f1cf7e35eb9f0d42a11033b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Electronic Lock-Pick

	Hacking device for bypassing electronic locks. This could be useful for rifling through people’s quarters or equipment lockers, though it won’t do much good against high-end security systems.

- [ ]  Moonshine

	Not everybody is happy drinking recycled water for months on end; Pandora Haze colonists and astronauts have been known to distil alcohol for their own amusement. Judging by the smell, this would make for decent floor cleaner.

- [ ]  Pocketbook

	Someone's lost notebook. The writing is smudged and mostly illegible, but judging by its cover, it's been well-cared for. Maybe you'll bump into its owner, one day.

- [ ]  Plume

- [ ]  Earth Seed Packets

	Pandora Haze encourages all of its space assets to grow produce, to diversify crew diets. This seed packet is meant to bring fresh vegetables to the Venus One colony, though since the label is torn, it’s impossible to tell which ones.

- [ ]  Notebook

	You only start to notice how important paper is when it begins to run out - that’s when you learn just how much more economical you can be with the space, filling every nook and cranny of a page with notes, doodles and diagrams. Make the most of this notebook.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/6ff2ac9487af31fc16c30b2fcede6f6c145a51bc-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Pain Meds

	It’s good for headaches. It’s good for toothaches. It’s good for basically any aches you have. Colds and the flu, too. It’s pretty much a wonder drug. It’s a shame this bottle’s barely half-full.

- [ ]  Paintbrush

- [ ]  Penknife

	Unfortunately, cutting a zombie results in little more than an increase in visible guts and bad smells, but that doesn’t mean this penknife isn’t useful. You never know when you might need it whilst traipsing through the zombie infested wilderness.

- [ ]  Prescription Pain Meds

	In the battle against pain, this stuff is the heavy artillery. Unfortunately, it’s also rather addictive. Best give this straight to the Doctor.

- [x]  Radio

	It’s a small, portable radio. No transmitter, unfortunately, but it’ll be useful nonetheless.

- [x]  Rope

	A coil of sturdy rope in good condition. Rope has thousands of uses.

- [ ]  Sports Bra

	Utilitarian rather than beautiful, but an essential piece of kit for runners. It’s been a long time since anyone’s bra matched their knickers.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/887c7c1fa65f22a303f444a8d5ff6cae4de96227-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Solar Charger

	A survivalist’s dream. So long as there’s sun, there’s power. This is worth its weight in gold.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a151c0f2f75df81d55c9563a0131bd5e5cea329e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Saucepan

	Janine managed to keep her kitchen well-stocked with saucepans, but this will definitely come in handy as a pretend astronauts helmet for the kids of Abel. With the world in ruins, they dream of escaping into space. Not a bad idea, actually. Shame there are no rocket scientists in the Township.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/742fc043a40bbca4c97bacb2d8f30b22de3a2ec8-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Seeds

	A clear bag full of a variety of seeds. The unlabelled tin can of the natural world. It’s not clear whether to plant them in the vegetable plot or the flower bed.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/cc1defc7b091a2a0c3d2429251df54b9b7d35051-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Shotgun Shells

	A box of shells for a shotgun. This could be the difference between surviving the night and dying by sundown.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/6cdb9bdefc9267b97db91e669b024cca33f17bdc-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Shorts

	They’re a bit grubby, and they were probably never in style, but they’re pretty easy to move in. Also they have pockets.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/ad8bb4f71215630abc6d3c2fbee7f3335df3df20-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Shirt

	A muddy, but wearable, collared shirt. It’s not your style, but it could be useful for bandages.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/f967c7cac936d74b75d865d48f4254e5a2154738-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Shotgun

	The iconic zombie-killer, with good reason. If properly handled, this’ll provide the user with a one-shot-stop on any zom heading their way.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/686382c9809a2434b56de9edb896fb7c7a94f110-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Hammer

	Man, this thing is heavy. Skull-crushingly heavy. Which is, funnily enough, a good reason to lug it round.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b501e787bb0ad878f04e9ef0e4789ee014572d5b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Sleeping bag

	There aren’t enough beds at Abel Township, and Janine refuses to share her king-size four poster with anyone except in emergency situations. Sleeping bags mean people have somewhere comfortable to sleep each night. Plus, they’re great for pretending to be a giant worm. As you do.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a0419afb1416aaee182c7c0dafd9936860d09a51-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Sewing Kit

	It’s hard to come across new clothes (sports bras notwithstanding), so sewing kits like these are invaluable for making sure small tears and lost buttons can be repaired.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/60aa19b6ac21da17af86562c46a430db5ddc4876-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Sword

	It’s a bit blunt, probably through hanging on someone’s wall for a couple of centuries. But it could still be lethal with a decent swing behind it.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/fd14070c0eaeafe44e12887d0d41b6fc8e6dc996-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Tool Box

	This toolbox would be perfect for any garage or workshop. It’s full of odd screws, rawlplugs, loose nuts and burnt-out fuses. But a few of the tools are still in working condition and the box itself isn’t damaged at all. This could be useful.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/03a65478d05e97ac39b3cb1a243bfd36adbc6193-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Toy car

	About as close as you’re going to come to owning a car nowadays. At least this one won’t bleed you dry through insurance bills. Though, if you do break it, there’s no getting it repaired. So be careful.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b03ff425cac5bb9b0f5c4babf6b40594e724a996-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Teddy bear

	Try not to think of the poor child who this once belonged to. Instead, picture the smiles on the faces on the kids back at Abel who will have a fuzzy friend to curl up with in bed tonight.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/af72182b51542f3233aad6a13883a6e3c2cfe158-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Tent

	Sleeping outside in the Abel courtyard is like attending a really long festival. Except, instead of music lulling you to sleep, you’re surrounded by gunfire and the groans of zombies.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/32f51170c39a18401c0997f94af73e824ab58b4d-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Toothbrush

	Just because the world has fallen apart doesn’t mean your teeth have to. This one is still new in its packet, luckily. Even post-apocalypse, people are still sniffy about sharing.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/b8d6b395207b6c4bcab35fcd622b2fbfec89d254-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Thermos flask

	Keeps hot things hot and cold things cold. How it works is a mystery. We’re just glad it does. A favourite of Runners’, because sometimes when you’re 10 kilometres or more from Abel’s gates all you really want is a nice hot cup of tea.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/48965a1c20d199eb60f135bb64c3184bd99b7782-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Thermal underwear

	Not exactly the most attractive thing to wear around your nethers, but who cares when you’re so toasty warm that you can survive a night in the comms shack without resorting to building a blanket fort.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/4b6bc017d8e86b39231dc57d856e9c9f1ad9de1f-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Tinned Food

	This is probably still good. The tin’s still sealed, even though it’s so bashed up you can’t tell what’s in it. Maybe it’s Spam.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/a257d9ff2d3488243a25d424accbdde36f9902df-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Tampons

	Some things are luxuries, and some things are just necessities. There’s a reason the old adverts for these showed women smiling while they ran.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/bf02c234e535cd95623ee88f52bd86b89d12eade-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Flashlight

	It provides light when there isn’t any, which is a pretty useful ability nowadays. It seems to still have some charge in the batteries, too.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/98b1c4f92110118d2b71eeabef84f2e7c46c9e2e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Trainers

	A complete pair of comfortable running shoes. They’re not in bad shape, considering the condition of their previous owner.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/e4944c9413b41668354da0ac4d97f9a69f20b06e-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Tennis racket

	Oh, thank god. Up until now Abel has only had a single tennis racket to call its own. Seeing how many times you can bounce the ball in the air without dropping it tends to get boring between attempt 200 and 300.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/f313932fe27c13c6706df8e9b62ec2af63f16f23-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Trousers

	In days gone by, these might have been worn to an office, or a business meeting. There’s less call for “smart-casual” now, but they’ll still keep someone’s legs warm.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/6a739aad7ec24c18b4a68649de3e3dfc5e21a272-h_150_2x.png)

- [x]  Umbrella

	Apocalypse or no, England is still England, which means rain. Lots and lots of rain. The good people of Abel will thank you for these.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/494c34541b752123a74d3f4493622706bbdf42e4-h_150_2x.png)
    ![](umbrella.png)

- [ ]  Underwear

	They’re not the most flattering underwear in the world, but they are still in the packet. And that means they’re clean.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/07f3a74c2f8002beb706f0c6f9651fc0b3835fe2-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  USB Key

	There are still working computers, but the only current method of transmitting large amounts of data is manual. That’s why portable data storage like this is so valuable.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/060bc3c0174677a5eaa217c7605b1c4ff7627747-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Vitamins

	An old bottle of SuperTed one-a-day multivitamins. Miraculously, it’s still sealed. Whoever owned this before civilisation fell must’ve been a collector.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/9b82e86471d96979e969ba241654391cc36f519b-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Wild food

	Doctor Myers has fully briefed you on what wild flora and fungi are edible, so you’re certain this won’t start a food poisoning pandemic throughout Abel. Not like last time.

    ![](https://zr.ncs.sixtostart.com/press/_public/_asset/67067a05be1e09ef1aa31daabbcc9ba0895d679a-h_150_2x.png)

- [ ]  Whisky

	A bottle of 16 year old single malt scotch. Sweet and smoky with a huge, peaty finish. Unfortunately, alcohol as strong as this is more likely to be an antiseptic than a post-prandial dram nowadays.
