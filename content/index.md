## Hello world!

![[logo.jpeg|200]]

Here's where I'll share my #projects and experiences I'm trying, career plans, and more! 

I'm a keen runner and have been [fleeing from zombies](https://zombiesrungame.com/zombies) since 2019, which has inspired a recent burst of [daily pixel art]("Zombies,%20Run!"%20Drawings.md).

I've been fortunate to go to a few conferences and workshops during my DPhil and learn a lot/share my own work. You can check out some of my notes and thoughts at the #conferences and #workshops tags. 

I hope you find what you're looking for here. Perhaps [this](particle_life_demo.md) would be a fun start?
