I'm giving polyphasic sleep a go, a paradigm where you choose to sleep in multiple sleep periods. This is often considered to be a contrast to more contemporary uni-phasic sleep that combines all sleep into a single time period. 
## Motivation
Mainly curiosity! I've been fortunate that my sleep quality has often been good, even though in the past I've definitely not slept enough and regularly would get by on ~5hrs of sleep a night. 

Recently, that's improved significantly and I'm now more interested in trying out different things while I have some free-er time between the end of my PhD and the start of my "career".
## Timeline
Inspired by Tris of [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/noboilerplate), I'm following a gently [modified E2 schedule](https://www.polyphasic.net/everyman-2/#lifestyle) - with a core sleep between 23:00 and 3:30, and two naps between 7:00-7:20 and 13:00-13:20.

I'll be easily able to organise myself around this on days when I'm working from home, but can see finding somewhere to sleep for 20 minutes in the office a little challenging. 
## Concerns
==I don't want to damage my health==! I'm lucky to have a brain that mostly does what I want it to do and I don't want that to change. I would however like to generally practice forming new habits and exercising willpower, which led to this plan in the first place. In that vein, I'm working on a **weekly check-in system** which I hope will allow me to take stock of how I'm doing and avoid slowly drifting off-plan.

I'm decidedly disappointed by the amount of research done on polyphasic sleep, so I'm approaching this with an experimental mindset. I want to track apparent energy levels, and any reliable sleep metric data I can get my hands on. If I find myself consistently flagging, or other habits start shifting in a way I'm not comfortable then I have no issue ending the experiment - but I want to make sure I give this an honest try.
