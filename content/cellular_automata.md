A series of rules carried out repeatedly on points in a space. 

Classic examples include [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) and [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 

You can find my implementations of Conway's Game of Life [here](https://github.com/JELAshford/game-of-life). It needs some polishing, but I like it as a way of tracking my progress as a programmer.
