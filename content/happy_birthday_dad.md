Thank you so much for everything you do for us, I always struggle to put into words how much you mean to me! I have you to thank for so many of the things I love doing: cycling, tinkering, and perhaps most relevant recently - programming!

I can still remember sitting with you as you (very patiently) walked me through programming in BBC Basic. With a lot of tinkering and trigonometry we build our own little version of Asteroids, even down to little thrusters that animated on the side of the ship!

Programming has become such an important part of me, my personal life and my work, and I have you to thank for starting that spark in me.

So, to remind us of that time we spent together, and hopefully to remind you how much that meant to me, I put together something familiar that we can play wherever we find ourselves! 

Love you so much, Dad!
