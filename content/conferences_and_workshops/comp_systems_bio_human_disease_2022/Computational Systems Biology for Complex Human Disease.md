In December 2022, I used some grant funding to attend the [WCSC `Computational Systems Biology for Complex Human Disease` Course](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/computational-systems-biology-for-complex-human-disease-from-static-to-dynamic-representations-of-disease-mechanisms-20221204/) on site at the Wellcome Genome Campus in Cambridge. The course was focussed on applying systems biology approached to the study of biomedical problems concerning human disease.  

I attended the course to learn more about disease networks, specifically how e can use existing *static* networks to interpret the outcomes of my genome-sequence based models, and use that understanding to construct *dynamic* disease networks to model disease pathways. In particular, the section of boolean networks caught my eye because they're a well studied and powerful technique that is used in a lot of disciplines, and I'm very fond of those!

The course was divided into lecture and practical sessions, and I learned a lot about some really powerful modelling techniques and analysis tools which I carried over into my final DPhil thesis work. Included in #compsysbio_2022 are some of the notes I took, of varying depth and detail, for future reference.
