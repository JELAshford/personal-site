> Cancer is a network disease, and alterations lead to a rewiring of the original network


Patient Specific Models
- Static: Mutation data that activates/inhibits genes force the node state
- Continuous: Genes expression sets initial conditions, and modifies the probabilities (up/down)
	- e.g. if expression A > B, pathway to A has higher probability 
- Run MaBoSS (and variants) and compare to WT
	- See which output states (e.g. Apoptosis/Invasion) change the most.
